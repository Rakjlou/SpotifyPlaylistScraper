# Spotify Playlist Scraper

A small underdeveloped one-page stupid tool to search & export Spotify playlists.
Oriented around emails available in playlists descriptions.

## Usage

- Open the `spotifyPlaylistScraper.html` in on your web browser
- Fill in your API Keys in the convenient inputs
- Type your search terms
- Enjoy life

## Features

### Classic Search

Classic search is just a pagination over playlists.

### Mass export

With one click and a bit of patience, get a JSON file with all playlists that include an email in their description.

## Full disclosure

It's a vibe-coded project as of now.
I spent exactly 2h on this, 1h48m dedicated to writing this README.

Therefore it's probably broken in many places.
